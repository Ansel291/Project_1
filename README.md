[x] Welcome to "wanted, dead or alive", the memory game

the object of the game is to select two cards of the same famous American west outlaws/lawmen/women  consecutively with only two chances.  If two of the same card has not been picked, the cards will turn over and you will have to remember where each card was originally.

The player that matches their cards the fastest and clears the entire board in the fastest time wins.

Create the winnner page, showing a picture of wyatt earp and doc holliday winning, and then the loser page with the guy shot

Congratulations player 1, you lived to see another day.

Sorry player 2, your memory was too slow, and you draw your gun fast enough.






Create a function that keeps track of when 2 cards are flipped, their value is stored and compared, and if the cards match, they remain showing.

Create a function for when all the cards are turned (when the counter turns to 10, the timer stops.

Then the code goes to player 2, and repeats itself

create a function that compares the times of player 1 versus player 2




Congratulations, player 1, you survived the battle and lived to tell about it.

Sorry player 2, your memory was too slow and you couldn't draw your weapon in time.

Play again
